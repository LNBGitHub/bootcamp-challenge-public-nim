Since there's no specific question or request, my job is to greet them back and offer assistance. Let me make sure the response is friendly and open-ended. Maybe something like, \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\" That should cover it. I should check for any typos and ensure the tone is welcoming. Yep, that looks good. Let's go with that.\n",
